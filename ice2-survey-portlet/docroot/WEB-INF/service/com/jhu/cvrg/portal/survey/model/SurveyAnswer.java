/**
 * The model interface for the SurveyAnswer service. Represents a row in the &quot;JHU_SurveyAnswer&quot; database table, with each column mapped to a property of this class.

 * <p>
 * Never modify this interface directly. Add methods to {@link com.jhu.cvrg.portal.survey.model.impl.SurveyAnswerImpl} and rerun ServiceBuilder to automatically copy the method declarations to this interface.

 *
 * <p>
 * Never reference this interface directly. All methods that expect a survey answer model instance should use the {@link SurveyAnswer} interface instead.
